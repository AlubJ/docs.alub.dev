# Things to be Aware of
Modding games in general is a bit of a task all things considered, and a lot of games have limitations that have not been broken by their respective modding community, TtGames' LEGO Games included.

## Mod Publication
Generally, sharing your mods is considered to be okay, and it is unlikely that any copyright holder will send out a DMCA claim. Feel free to share your mods. You can publish your mods either by zipping up **the modded files only** (this is important) and instructions on how to install the mod, or use a mod manager like [Reloaded-ii](https://github.com/Reloaded-Project/Reloaded-II).

Never put your mod behind a paywall. This is a legally dubious tactic in trying to earn money from your mods but could potentially put yourself at legal risk. Just, like share your mods for free man.

## Format Limits
The model format TtGames uses does a lot of pointer hopping, which means adding new things inside fo the model is extremely complex. Adding and removing attributes is a planned feature within BactaTank Classic, but as of current is not possible. Adding new textures, materials, meshes or anything else is not possible.
